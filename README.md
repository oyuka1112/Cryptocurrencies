# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
Created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment by processing to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we're looking for, I decided to use unsupervised learning: a clustering algorithm. 
Used the followings:
- preprocessing the database,
- reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
- clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
- visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots. 
## Results
1. Cleaned the dataframe
2. Scaled the data
3. Reduced dimensions using PCA 98 columns to 3 PCA
4. Clustering Cryptocurrencies using k-means
5.
